<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am a research scientist in the FAIR team at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Meta</a> (Paris). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the same team at Meta and in the <a class="url" href="https://team.inria.fr/scool/">SCOOL</a> team at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-lille">INRIA Lille</a>. I received my Ph.D. in computer science at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Politecnico di Milano</a> advised by <a href="https://restelli.faculty.polimi.it/MyWebSite/index.shtml">Marcello Restelli</a>.
  
My main research interest is <b>reinforcement learning</b>.</p>
